<p align="justify">Hello! This is <b>OutFrag.</b> I'm a developer from Bangladesh. I completed bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Software Engineering from <a href="https://www.aiub.edu/" rel="nofollow">American International University-Bangladesh</a>. Every day, I learn new things and confront new obstacles, and I aim to give it my all in order to deliver the finest outcomes possible. I consider myself to be a lifelong learner who likes experimenting with new  technology. I'm looking for a method to connect with an organization that can help me develop my skills, expand my knowledge, and reach my full potential I'm open to a variety of ideas that might help me gain perspective.</p>
